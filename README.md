# Employee Management & Security-Enabled Web Portal

##  Project Overview  
A role-based employee management web application with dual login (Admin/Employee) and interactive dashboards for:  
- Attendance Tracking  
- Performance Monitoring  
- Training & Development  

The system ensures secure access and data protection by implementing:  
- **Role-Based Access Management (RBAC)**  
- **OTP Verification via SMTP**  
- **CAPTCHA Authentication**  

Admins have the ability to add or delete employee accounts, ensuring proper account lifecycle management.
